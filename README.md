# React + Vite

# 🧪 Spockly Demo — Blockly + React Starter

A minimal React app that integrates [Google Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/) with Python code generation. This is the starting point for building your own Blockly-based data science environment — you’ll even be able to add your own blocks and languages like R!

## 🚀 Features

- Blockly in a modern React app
- Generates Python code from blocks

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js (LTS version)](https://nodejs.org/) — includes npm
